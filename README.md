# Online-Train-Ticket-Booking-System
The Online Train Ticket Booking System is a console-based Java application designed to simplify train ticket booking and management using JDBC and an Oracle database. It allows users to view available trains, book tickets, cancel reservations, and check booking details with real-time updates. The system ensures data consistency through transaction management using commit and rollback operations and handles errors effectively to maintain a smooth user experience.

Key features include viewing train details (train number, name, source, destination, available seats, and fare), booking tickets with automatic seat assignment, canceling tickets to free up seats, and viewing booked tickets with essential information like train number, seat number, and fare. The system is built using Java, JDBC, SQL, and operates through a Command Line Interface (CLI).

Future enhancements could include adding a Graphical User Interface (GUI), integrating online booking and payment gateways, implementing user authentication, and introducing a waitlist and notification system to improve usability and functionality.
